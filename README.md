## Description

This is my portfolio project in Next JS where I have shown my skills, projects and personal details with qualifications.

## Features

I have used new industry tech, Next JS to make a server-side rendered website for faster loading of pages.  
Along side I also used [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/) for showing beautiful and modern animations and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) pre-built component library to make my website faster.
